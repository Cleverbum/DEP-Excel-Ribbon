# DEP-Excel-Ribbon
This is a project to deal with two internal systems interacting with one another poorly. It uses selenium from an excel based report.

You'll need to download the strongnamed Selenium NuGet Packages to make the project compile.
  Packages are here: http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/3.141/selenium-dotnet-strongnamed-3.141.0.zip


I would not anticipate it being of any use to anyone external to the company I work for.
